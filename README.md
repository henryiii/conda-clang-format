# conda-clang-format

This is a pre-commit hook for [conda-forge/clang-format](https://github.com/conda-forge/clangdev-feedstock), suitable for local runs or [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci).


## Updating

To update, change the pinned clang-format value in `environment.yml` and make a new tag (lightweight tags are fine).
